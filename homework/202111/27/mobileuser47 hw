Reliable, scalable and maintainbale application


Most of application is data intensive in stead of compute-intensive

Data-intensive applicate:
	- Database
	- Remember the result of expensive(cache)
	- Search indexes
	- Stream procession
	- Batch processing



Fundamentals:
	- Reliability
			§ Systenm shoul work correctly even in the face of adversity(heardware, software, human fault).
			§ Performs function expected
			§ Tolerate mistakes
			§ Performance is good enough under expected load and data volume.
			§ Prevents unauthorized access and abuse.
		Hardware faults
			§ Usually solved by redundant resources + fault-tolerance techniques
		Software faults
			§ Test
			§ Process iolation
			§ Allow preccess to crash and restart
			§ Measure and monitoring
			§ Analyzing
		Human fault
	- Scalability
		○ System's ability to cope with increase load
		Load: 
			- QPS
			- Write/Read ratio
			- Simultaneously active users
			- Hit rate on a cache
			- Etc
		Describe performance
			- 
		
	- Maintability 
		○ Should be easy to adapt the system to new use cases.
