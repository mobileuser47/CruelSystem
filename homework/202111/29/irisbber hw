Reliable, scalable and maintainbale application


Most of application is data intensive in stead of compute-intensive

Data-intensive applicate:
	- Database
	- Remember the result of expensive(cache)
	- Search indexes
	- Stream procession
	- Batch processing



Fundamentals:
	- Reliability
			§ Systenm shoul work correctly even in the face of adversity(heardware, software, human fault).
			§ Performs function expected
			§ Tolerate mistakes
			§ Performance is good enough under expected load and data volume.
			§ Prevents unauthorized access and abuse.
		Hardware faults
			§ Usually solved by redundant resources + fault-tolerance techniques
		Software faults
			§ Test
			§ Process isolation
			§ Allow process to crash and restart
			§ Measure and monitoring
			§ Analyzing
		Human fault
	- Scalability
		○ System's ability to cope with increase load
		Load: 
			- QPS
			- Write/Read ratio
			- Simultaneously active users
			- Hit rate on a cache
			- Etc
		Describe performance
			- Increase load, keep system resource unchanged, see how it the performance.’
			- Increase load, how you increase the resource to keep the performance unchanged.
			- User percentile is good way to measure performance.
			- Outlier:离群值
			- Queue delays -> offen account for large part of the response time at high percentile.
		Approaches for cop with load
			- Vertical scaling (add resource to single node)
			- Horizontal scaling: add more machines
	- Maintainability
		○ Operability
			- Monitoring the health and quickly restore 
			- Tackling down the cause of problems
			- Keep software and platform up to date
			- Anticipating future problems
			- Establish good practice and tools for deployment and config and more
			- Performing complex maintenance tasks, such as move an application from one platform to another
			- Maintain the security of the system
			- Doc
		○ Simplicity
			- Abstraction
		○ Evolvability
			
			
		
	- Maintability 
		○ Should be easy to adapt the system to new use cases.
	


Data Model

Relational model:
	- Business data processing
	- Lay out all the data in table
	

NOSQL
	- Motivation
		○ Scalability (larger dataset or high write throughput)
		○ Specialized query operations
		○ Need more dynamic and expressive data model
	

Relational database vs Document database

	- Document database is schema flexible and beetter performance due to locality(no need to join)
	- Relational database is good at joins, n to n and n t one relationships
